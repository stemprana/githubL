> Introduce yourself to github

	git config --global user.name "NAME"
	git config --global user.email "EMAIL"

	git config --global --list  [in case you want to see global configurations]

> Create a repository online
	[In theory from one of the tutorials this is not necessary but it gives me an error if I do not do it]


> From the command line got to local dir where we have the files. Folder does not need to have the same name as repository

	[Go to local dir]
	
	git init [creates '.git' hidden folder with all the data required to track project]
	git init . [if you want to initialize with all files in the directory]


> Configure server ('remote' in git terminology) to contact. This has to be done a single time
	
	git remote add origin 'https://github.com/USER/REPOSITORYNAME.git' [ adds server named 'origin' with the given URL]

	[If you screw up setting URLs following commands are useful]
	git remote -v [lists defined severs]
	git remote set-url origin URL [Changes the URL of existing server named 'origin']
	
> Add files to staging area and commit changes
	

	git add "FILENAME" [Adds files individually to the staging area]
	git add . 
        git add -all [Add all files to the staging area]
	
	git commit -m "MESSAGE" [Commit changes]

> Push

	git push --set-upstream origin master [The first time we push we have to tell which server to push to, the '--set-upstream' flag lets us do it only one time]
